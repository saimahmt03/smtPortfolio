                    <h2>Saimah Malawi Tocalo</h2>
                    <p>Saimah is a Meranao Filipino who was born in Baguio Medical Center, Baguio, Benguet, Philippines, on November 3, 1994.</p>
                    
                    <p>She graduated from Mindanao State University Main Campus, located in the Islamic City of Marawi, with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology major in Database Systems on June 21, 2018.</p>

                    <p>She completed her internship at Infor PSSC Inc. (Infor Manila) from February 2018 to June 2018. Her internship involved business analysis and application testing, marking her first experience in the IT industry.</p>

                    <p>After graduating, she did not immediately enter the IT industry. Due to cultural and family expectations, she worked at a security agency owned by relatives, gaining experience in finance and independent living in the National Capital Region.</p>

                    <p>Despite family disapproval of working in corporate settings and living away from her homeland, she pursued her goals. In March 2019, she became an Application Developer Trainee at IBM. However, due to the pandemic, her family took her home for safety.</p>

                    <p>Unstoppable in her drive, she sought IT opportunities online in 2020. In August 2020, she joined Microgenesis Business Systems as an Application Support Engineer, where she worked in technical support, application testing, and business analysis until September 2021.</p>

                    <p>A month later, in October 2021, she was hired at CIBI, where she currently works as a Full Stack Developer.</p>

                    <p>Saimah believes her dream is a debt she owes to herselfâ€”one she must fulfill.</p>
